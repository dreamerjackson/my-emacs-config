<p>I started working remotely in 2012. Since then I&#8217;ve worked for big companies and small, organisations with outstanding remote working cultures, and others that probably would have difficulty  spelling the word without predictive text. I broadly classify my experiences into three tiers;</p>



<h2>Little r remote</h2>



<p>The first kind of remote work I call <em>little r</em> remote. </p>



<p>Your company has an office, but it&#8217;s not convenient or you don&#8217;t want to work from there. It could be the commute is too long, or its in the next town over, or perhaps a short plane flight away. Sometimes you might go into the office for a day or two a week, and should something serious arise you could join your co-workers onsite for an extended period of time.</p>



<p>If you often hear people say they are going to work from home to get some work done, that&#8217;s little r remote.</p>



<h2>Big R remote</h2>



<p>The next category I call <em>Big R</em> remote. Big R remote differs mainly from little r remote by the tyranny of distance. It&#8217;s not impossible to visit your co-workers in person, but it is inconvenient. Meeting face to face requires a day’s flying. Passports and boarder crossings are frequently involved. The expense and distance necessitates week long sprints and commensurate periods of jetlag recuperation.</p>



<p>Because of timezone differences meetings must be prearranged and periods of overlap closely guarded. Communication becomes less spontaneous and care must be taken to avoid committing to unsustainable working hours.</p>



<h2>Gothic ℜ remote </h2>



<p>The final category is basically Big R remote working on hard mode. Everything that was hard about Big R remote, timezone, travel schedules, public holidays, daylight savings, video call latency, cultural and language barriers is multiplied for each remote worker.</p>



<p>In person meetings are so rare that without a focus on written asynchronous communication progress can repeatedly stall for days, if not weeks, as miscommunication leads to disillusionment and loss of trust.</p>



<p>In my experience, for knowledge workers, little r remote work offers many benefits over <a href="https://twitter.com/davecheney/status/761693088666357760">the open office hell scape</a> du jour. Big R remote takes a serious commitment by all parties and if you are the first employee in that category you will bare most of the cost to making Big R remote work for you.</p>



<p>Gothic ℜ remote working should probably be avoided unless all those involved have many years of working in that style <i>and</i> the employer is committed to restructuring the company as a remote first organisation. It is not possible to succeed in a Gothic ℜ remote role without a culture of written communication and asynchronous decision making mandated, <i>and consistently enforced,</i><span> by the leaders of the company.</span></p>
